# nutsnbolts Library

The STL files in this directory are generated using the (nutsnbolts)[https://github.com/JohK/nutsnbolts] library 
by (JohK)[https://github.com/JohK]. That library is licensed under GPLv3, and since I don't want to introduce potential 
licensing issues, I'm not including the libray in my repository. The pre-rendered STL files should work without the 
library anyway. However, if you want to rebuild the components, you can - cloning the Github repository is integrated 
into the top-level Makefile.
