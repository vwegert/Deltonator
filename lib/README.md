# External Libraries

## nutsnbolts Library

The directory nutsnbolts contains the [nutsnbolts](https://github.com/JohK/nutsnbolts) library 
by (JohK)[https://github.com/JohK]. 

That library is licensed under GPLv3, and since I don't want to introduce potential licensing issues, I'm not including 
the libray directly in my repository. The pre-rendered STL files in the parts/vitamins folder will work without the 
library anyway. However, if you want to rebuild the components, you can - importing the submodule from its Github 
repository is integrated into the top-level Makefile.

## MCAD Library

The directory MCAD contains the [MCAD](https://github.com/openscad/MCAD) library by various authors. 

The licensing of that library is a mess (sorry), and since I don't want to introduce potential licensing issues, I'm 
not including the libray directly in my repository. The pre-rendered STL files should work without the library anyway.
