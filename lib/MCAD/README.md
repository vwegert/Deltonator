# MCAD Library

The STL files in this directory are generated using the (MCAD)[https://github.com/openscad/MCAD] library 
by various authors. The licensing of that library is a mess (sorry), and since I don't want to introduce potential 
licensing issues, I'm not including the libray directly in my repository. The pre-rendered STL files should work without 
the library anyway. However, if you want to rebuild the components, you can - importing the submodule from its Github 
repository is integrated into the top-level Makefile.
