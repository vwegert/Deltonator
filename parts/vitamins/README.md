# Vitamins

This directory contains the files that produce parts that will have to be bought ready-made to prepare the printer.

## Bearings

Some of the bearings come from an extended version of the MCAD library, others are pre-generated from local 
instructions.

## GT2 pulleys

## Threaded Inserts

## Nuts

## Screws

The screws are pre-generated using the nutsnbolts library. Since that library (or any library) might not stay stable,
the repository contains the pre-rendered STL files.

## Stepper Motors

The motors are pre-generated using the MCAD library. Since that library (or any library) might not stay stable,
the repository contains the pre-rendered STL files.

## Switches

The SS-5GL switch model was downloaded from the [Omron Web Site](https://www.omron.com/ecb/products/sw/12/ss.html) and
then converted from STEP to STL manually using FreeCAD.

## V-Wheel

The file vwheel_b17021_rev_3.pdf was downloaded directly from the 
[buildlog site](http://www.buildlog.net/documents/b17021_rev_3.pdf). As far as I can tell from the PDF file, this file
has been licensed under a CC-BY-SA-3.0 license, but I have not been able to determine the actual author. Please
